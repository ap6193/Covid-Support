  <h1>Doctor's Advice </h1>
<div class='container-fluid header1'>
  <p>
    1)Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren’t available, use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br><br>
    2)If you aren’t feeling well, stay home. This includes visiting the doctor’s office. Call your doctor’s office first to share your symptoms and ask if you should come in.<br><br>
    3)Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue and throw it in the trash. Then, immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.<br><br>
    4)Avoid close contact with people who are sick. There are times people mistake COVID-19 symptoms for cold and allergy symptoms, like a runny nose or headache.<br><br>
    5)Follow public health advice on attending school, avoiding crowds, and other physical distancing measures to limit spread of COVID-19.
    Follow your local health department guidance on masks. When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your mouth and nose. Masks do help prevent the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>
    6)Misinformation about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine has caused confusion during the pandemic. If you have concerns about COVID-19, read Know the Facts About Coronavirus (COVID-19).<br><br>
    7)Get your flu shot, if you haven’t already. Flu season is active in the fall and winter. You can get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.<br><br>
